    <p class="list-group-item-text">Your vote is your choice. This site exists to help people find the candidate best-placed to challenge hard Brexit in the next Parliament. This is (for now at least) a free country, and if you don't like our recommendation you don't need to take it on board.</p>

<div class="list-group-item">
    <h2 class="list-group-item-heading">Where the fuck does this data come from?</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text">We've looked at the results in each seat at the 2015 election (or more recently if there was a by-election) and recommended the party with the best chance of fighting hard Brexit in the next Parliament. Where a candidate campaigned for Leave, we have recommended the person with the best chance to replace them. Similarly, where a Conservative MP has been outspoken against Brexit, we have recommended them.

<div class="list-group-item">
    <h2 class="list-group-item-heading">But I hate the person you've suggested. I don't want to fucking vote for them.</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text">Mate, we hear you. Our First Past The Post voting system means unless you vote for one of the parties in with a chance of winning in your seat, your vote is wasted. After the election, join the campaign to make votes matter. In the meantime, we have to work with what we've got. You could arrange to swap your vote with someone in a different seat, or offer to help a candidate from your preferred party in another seat.</p>

<div class="list-group-item">
    <h2 class="list-group-item-heading">Your fucking data's wrong. That prick supports Brexit.</h4>
    <p class="list-group-item-text">We're refining the database as we learn more about candidates in each seat. If you want us to update a recommendation, tweet us on <a href="http://twitter.com/wtfdoivotefor">@wtfdoivotefor</a>.</p>
